The slick has spread 10km from the Raroa platform site off the Taranaki coast since Friday. The spill happened when oil company OMV was transferring oil from Raroa to the oil tanker Nectar. Maritime New Zealand earlier said the oil could turn up as tar balls if it hit the coast. But after a flight over the spill area yesterday                                                                           ,that now seemed unlikely                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,said Maritime spokeswoman Sophie Hazelhurst. She said there were no concerns for local wildlife. “The environment’s ... doing a really good job of breaking it up                                                                                                 ,” she said. “The conditions ... are quite dynamic.” She said “trajectory modelling” software indicated any oil was still a few days from reaching the shore                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,if it made landfall at all.

She was editor of the NZ Woman’s Weekly from the end of 2010 to 2013. Ms Stuart will take on the role of director of media and communications — combining the work of a chief press secretary for Mr Little with a wider communications strategy oversight for Labour. In the past,the two roles were done by different people but Labour’s smaller caucus means it now had less funding for staff. The full leadership team includes chief of staff Matt McCarten and political director Neale Jones.

Burning more coal for energy is an environmentally retrograde step                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,he says. Part of the problem is that politicians put short-term popularity from backing popular campaigns ahead of working out a long-term energy policy. We now import coal because politicians aren't able to handle the shale gas issue                                                                               ,Mr. Roiss says.His criticism of politicians comes from the unusual standpoint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,for the CEO of an Austrian company partially owned by the state                                                                                                                                                                  ,of political independence.

U.S. shale-gas production increased from 425 million cubic meters a day in 2010 to 700 million cubic meters a day this year,according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' 2012 World Oil Outlook. The International Energy Agency has called the impact of shale-gasenergy in the U.S. profound,adding that the resource would help make the U.S. energy self-sufficient in net terms by 2035. Currently                                                                                               ,it imports about 20% of its primary energy needs                                    ,the IEA says.The situation in Europe could hardly be more of a contrast. In the EU,regulatory jurisdiction is at the level of the 27 national member states.

Even if it were proven that the drilling had no effect on the wine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,who wants to buy wine out of a gas field? says Sabine Randl                                                                                                                    ,a member of the grass roots opposition group Weinviertel statt Gasviertel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,or Wine Region instead of Gas Region. Environmentalists are concerned about not only the use of chemicals in the fracking process and their possible effect on ground water                                                                                                                       ,but are also concerned about the amount of water needed. There have also been concerns about fracking triggering earth tremors and contamination of areas around the drilling sites.Opposition to fracking in the Weinviertel became so strong that politicians pushed through a bill in parliament to now require an extensive environmental impact study before giving a new fracking project the go ahead. Before the bill such studies weren't always required. These studies are very strict,which means that fracking won't happen                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,at least not in Lower Austria [where the region is located]                                                                                                                                                           ,said Irmgard Poschacher                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Environment.

Shale gas isn't going anywhere. It will still be there a couple years from now,he said.Mr. Huijskes also remains confident that the proposed pipeline Nabucco West will be built,but that he expects its shape to change. Nabucco West--a shortened version of the originally proposed Nabucco pipeline--would transport gas from the Caspian region to Europe,helping to reduce the continent's reliance on Russian energy. OMV is a partner in the consortium behind the Nabucco project.Write to Nicole Lundeen at Subscribe to WSJ: [ 09-19-12 1241ET ] Document DJON000020120919e89j0005nOMV abandons Austrian shale gas plans364 words17 September 201216:25Reuters News LBAEnglish(c) 2012 Reuters LimitedVIENNA,Sept 17 (Reuters) - Austrian energy group OMVhas abandoned plans to produce shale gas in Austria because the hoops it would have to jump through to address environmental concerns made the project economically unviable,it said on Monday.Shale gas is trapped in rocks and requires fracking to unlock - a drilling method that involves pumping pressurised water ,chemicals and sand underground and is criticised by many environmentalists,who say it can pollute water supplies.Energy groups are keen to explore the prospects of a new type of gas reserve in the centre of Europe,where conventional supplies are dwindling,following a boom in U.S. shale-gas production that has freed the country from gas imports.But OMV said the introduction of a law in Austria that obliges companies to have a detailed environmental inspection before each planned project meant it was not worth its while. In this context,the project is economically not viable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,OMV's head of exploration and production in Austria                                                                                                                                                                  ,Christopher Veit                                                                                ,told Austrian ORF radio.OMV had said last December it planned to spend up to 130 million euros ($171 million) plus development costs to search for shale gas in Austria,but only if environmental issues could be resolved.Like all exploration projects                                                                                               ,the chances of its panning out were slight                                                             ,it said at the time        ,but success could have covered Austrian demand of 8 billion cubic metres for two or three decades,it estimated.Oil majors and small exploration companies have flocked to exploit what are estimated to be vast reserves of unconventional gas in Poland.Austria                           ,Hungary and the Czech Republic are seen as having some potential but not on the scale of Poland,and not enough to justify huge regulatory hurdles. Shale exploration is on hold in the Czech Republic due to environmental concerns.An OMV spokesman said the decision would not affect any potential future plans to explore share gas elsewhere.

Yet hopes of a wave of consolidation taking out many of the London-listed independents seem likely to be disappointed. Talking to people in the industry in the past few weeks,it seems everyone is running the rule over everyone else                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,says Richard Griffith of Evolution Securities. Whether any of these will go to execution                                                       ,though                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,is a moot point. If ever a deal was going to work                                                                                                          ,it was Eni and Burren. Eni is Burren's partner in the M'Boundi field in Congo. Unlike some of its peers                                                                                                                                  ,Burren's prospects were not dependent on success with some future drilling.In just about any other match-up                                                                                                                                                             ,the scope for disagreement is much greater.The fair value for prospects that the target hopes will turn into discoveries is a perpetual source of dissent. A year ago Premier Oil said it had ended takeover talks with an unnamed potential bidder,rumoured to be Dubai Energy. Analysts suggested the valuation of Premier's exploration programme was likely to have been a factor.Often                                                                                                                                     ,a substantial premium for exploration potential is already in the price. Andrew Whittock of Oriel Securities says: Tullow and Soco                                                             ,at the extreme                                                                                                                                                                                   ,are already anticipating further exploration success in the share price. The market is assuming they will make further discoveries                                                                                                                                       ,and I haven't come across an oil company that is prepared to pay up in those circumstances. So although there may be the occasional swoop for attractive undervalued assets,such as Royal Dutch Shell's recent attempt to buy into Regal Petroleum's gas fields in Ukraine                                                                                 ,a full-on merger rush looks unlikely.The exception                                                                                                                                    ,perhaps                                                                                                                                   ,will be at the bottom of the market on Aim                            ,where dozens of companies are listed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,many of whom floated in the boom of 2005-06.

All rights reservedIran appears to be pushing ahead with its third major liquefied natural gas project,known as Iran LNG,with the assistance of European companies.Last week,Ali Khayrandish,the managing director of Iran LNG,was reported as saying that one Chinese and four European companies had been in talks to secure liquefied natural gas supplies from the project.Iranian officials are saying they expect the construction of the 10m tonne per year capacity plant to be completed by 2010,although most industry analysts say this is unrealistic and the plant would take a few more years to be built even if started now.The activity comes despite intensifying international pressure on energy companies not to make new investments in Iran.However,Iran has already signed a Euros 400m (Dollars 585m,Pounds 286m) contract with an engineering consortium,made up of two Iranian companies and an Italian company,to build a treatment,or gas sweetening,plant for the Iran LNG project.APS Engineering,a small,private Italian engineering company that has worked for a variety of clients including Eni,the Italian oil and gas multinational,told the Financial Times it was the Italian company in the consortium. It said it would play a rather minor role .This contract was awarded just days after the design plans for the plant were submitted to Iranian officials by another consortium,made up of a German company,Linde,Hyundai of South Korea,and Snamprogetti,an Eni subsidiary. The design contract was initially agreed as far back as 2002.Iran has the world's second biggest gas reserves,but has failed to develop its prolific South Pars gas field as fast as it would like because of the reluctance of oil companies to invest under the cloud of tensions over Iran's nuclear programme.Royal Dutch Shell,Total and Repsol have stakes in Iran's other two main LNG projects,though none is likely to make final investment decisions unless international diplomatic pressure on Iran eases.Iran has said it will not wait beyond the deadline of June 2008 for these companies to move ahead with the projects and seems eager to call the bluff of US policymakers. In Saudi Arabia yesterday,Gholam-Hossein Nozari,oil minister,said US sanctions against Iran would have no impact on the country's crude oil and natural gas production plans.Paulo Scaroni,Eni's chief executive,told the FT this week Eni had no intention of pulling out of Iran. The company's policy is not to get involved with any new projects,however.Other companies are,however,taking a bolder stance when it comes to Iran LNG. Union Fenosa,the Spanish energy company,says its subsidiary,Socoin,was awarded a Euros 32.5m engineering contract for Iran LNG in August.OMV,the Austrian oil and gas company,in April signed a preliminary agreement with Tehran for a stake in Iran LNG,but this is yet to be finalised. Our interest in the Iran LNG project lies on the table,it said.20071116A102.187Document FTFT000020071116e3bg00008COMPANIES - EUROPEHungary criticised over Mol protection.By NIKKI TAIT254 words14 November 2007 Financial Times FTFTAsia Ed1 Page 18 English(c) 2007 The Financial Times Limited.

The Commission is concerned that the law may contain unjustified restrictions on the free movement of capital and right of establishment by introducing onerous requirements for public takeover bids allowing public authorities to appoint a member on the boards of energy companies with the right to participate in the management and the control of the companies concerned,it said.Hungary has insisted that the changes do not contravene EU rules.However,they have been widely seen as a response to a hostile bid for Mol from Austria's OMV,and locally tagged lex Mol .Charlie McCreevy,the single markets commissioner,wrote last month to Budapest,warning against adoption of the amendments.The increased pressure comes just a month after the European Court of Justice overturned a 47-year-old law that had protected Volkswagen from hostile takeovers.The European Commission had first taken Germany to Europe's top court in October 2004 in an effort to get rid of the law,arguing that it was a barrier to cross-border investment in Europe - in short,a restriction on the free movement of capital within the EU.20071114A118.002Document FTFT000020071114e3be0001pFT REPORT - AUSTRIA 2007Phoenix rises from the ashes.By HAIG SIMONIAN1,009 words29 October 2007 Financial Times FTFTSurveys AST1 Page 5 English(c) 2007 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reservedFor years,Austria's state-owned steel industry was a byword for mismanagement as politicised decision-making drove profits into the ground.More recently,a phoenix has risen from the ashes,as a new generation of executives,liberated by privatisation,have run their businesses on the basis of free market principles,rather than party politics.This year,the wheel turned full circle when Voestalpine,Austria's leading steelmaker,acquired Bohler Uddeholm,a smaller specialist,to recreate the single group broken up by privatisation.Reuniting Bohler and Voest has created Austria's second-biggest industrial company after the OMV energy group. But rather than harking back to Austrian Industries,the former state producer,the new concern ranks among Europe's most efficient and profitable manufacturers.Voest's Euros 3.72bn takeover of Bohler followed an unsolicited approach from CVC,the UK-based private equity group. After the raiders were rejected,Voest arrived as White Knight,and the rest is history.Even with Bohler,which will form a new,independent fifth division,Voest remains only a mid-sized producer compared with Arcelor Mittal,the world's biggest steelmaker. But investment,rising productivity and a reputation for the quality steels required for special applications - such as cars - has allowed the company to create a lucrative and growing franchise.In steel,its biggest division,Voest ranks third in Europe after Arcelor Mittal and Thyssen Krupp. Key customers include leading car companies such as BMW,Daimler and Peugot. In rails,Voest's second biggest division before Bohler,its position is even stronger. Proprietary technology lies behind the company's trademark ultralong and resistant rails,required by Europe's high-speed train operators.Proliform,which makes specialised steel sections,and automotive,comprise Voest's two other divisions,creating a group that - before Bohler - had sales of Euros 7.05bn in 2006-7 business year. Operating profits,buoyed by strong demand from rail and automotive,along with firm prices for specialised products,jumpednearly 40 per cent to exceed Euros 1bn for the first time. Net earnings soared by 45.4 per cent to Euros 764.9m,prompting a near-doubling of the dividend to Euros 1.45.Wolfgang Eder,Voest's chief executive,says the figures will climb even higher with Bohler on board. Once consolidated,he forecasts group sales this year will reach Euros 10.5bn,with operating profits of about Euros 1.4bn and net earnings more than Euros 1bn. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2007-8,reported in August,and excluding any Bohler contribution,soared almost 60 per cent to Euros 242m on a near 15 per cent rise in sales to Euros 1.96bn. Demand remains strong and the outlook is still upbeat,says Mr Eder,a lawyer who took the top job in April 2004. The steel industry's typically long-term contracts allow Voest to be relatively comfortable with its predictions,while prices look set to remain favourable all year. Mr Eder admits Voest has been lifted by a booming world economy and surging demand that has pushed up prices and margins.But it has also benefited from steady improvements in its own operations and portfolio. In the past 10 years,we've very much developed our portfolio,shifting the mix towards higher value added products. Underlying the process has been constant investment at Voest's flagship Linz plant,where most steelmaking is based. The site,lying alongside the river Danube,has most recently benefited from a Euros 2bn investment programme,now reaching completion. The scheme has seen the replacement of the group's mainblast furnace and new plants for zinc coating and for colour-coating steels to meet increasingly exacting requirements of the motor and white goods sectors,respectively.But Voest has also benefited from a rigorous concentration on key activities,divesting non-core business either via outright sales or into joint ventures. That focus,as much as global demand factors,have been behind the more than tenfold rise in profits from just Euros 70.4m in 2002-3.Mr Eder admits that automotive,the smallest and - until Bohler was consolidated in July - youngest of Voest's four divisions,has yet to prove its worth.Margins have risen to 5.2 per cent from 2.5 per cent in the past three years as management has tried to improve efficiency. That has moved the operation into line with the better performing competitors. But Mr Eder makes clear the future of the division,which supplies pre-shaped parts to niche carmakers such as Porsche and Bentley,is not guaranteed unless it can lift profitability further. We have set a target to take margins above 8 per cent by 2010. If we don't manage it,we'll have to reconsider,he warns.Automotive apart,the mood at Voest remains upbeat. A new Euros 800m three-year investment plan is due to raise output from 5.5m to 6m tonnes by removing bottlenecks. After that,Mr Eder acknowledges further expansion at Linz would be impossible. We'd need to build an extra storey,he says of the already packed site.So speculation is rising that the group,facing rising environmental burdens,including differences with the government over CO 2 emission trading rights,may look abroad to build an additional works.Where that might be,or when it will happen,remain top secret. We're starting to think about what we should do next,says Mr Eder. But he stresses no decisions have been taken,and his first priority remains consolidating Bohler.Initial plans for a rights issue alongside debt to finance the deal have been scrapped,and Voest will now fund the takeover exclusively through borrowing. That will raise gearing to more than 80 per cent - a level Mr Eder agrees will have to be reduced eventually.Once borrowing falls - and assuming demand remains strong - attention may turn to new sites. In time,the Bohler acquisition may just seem a step along the way.20071029S105.070Document FTFT000020071029e3at00022FT REPORT - AUSTRIA 2007 - FRONT PAGESullen mood belies economic affluence.By ERIC FREY and HAIG SIMONIAN1,229 words29 October 2007 Financial Times FTFTSurveys AST1 Page 1 English(c) 2007 The Financial Times Limited. All rights reservedNext summer,Austria will face one of the biggest logistical and security challenges in its history when,with neighbouring Switzerland,it stages the Euro 2008 European football championship,opening its doors to millions of visitors from home and abroad.The event will,for most Austrians,eclipse even the festivities accompanying the Mozart Year of 2006 and,as with the celebrations for the country's most famous composer,project Austria's image across the world.A traditional tourist destination,Austria can promise excellent facilities and highly professional management for the football extravaganza.But one element might be missing for a suitably festive spirit: the national football team. In spite of a recent surprise win,Austria's players are among Europe's weakest and hold little promise in the contest.Something of the same may be said for the country as a whole. A strong economy,good infrastructure and excellent public services make Austria one of the most prosperous and agreeable locations in Europe - arguably the world. Vienna,the capital,ranks regularly among the world's foremost cities for lifestyle,while the quality of life in Austria as a whole compares favourablywith virtually everywhere else.Yet in spite of its advantages and current affluence,the mood of Austrians is remarkably sullen right now. Rather than euphoria - or at least quiet contentment - dissatisfaction with the government,and with membership of the European Union,are more often heard.Domestically,the grand coalition of centre left Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party,headed by Alfred Gusenbauer,chancellor and Social Democratic party leader,holds an enviable two-thirds majority in parliament.Yet despite its commanding position,the public perception is that the new administration has not achieved much since being formed in January after three months of bickering following the October 2006 general election.Mr Gusenbauer replaced Wolfgang Schussel,then leader of the People's party and Austria's best known politician abroad,after a narrow victory at the polls. In spite of an impressive economic record,Mr Schussel's right of centre coalition failed to convince voters it also had a social conscience. Not surprisingly,social policy has been at the forefront of the new government's plans. But apart from agreements to increase social spending and for the first time set a minimum wage,the impression is that not much else has happened.The mood is as disenchanted on the EU with the latest Euro-barometer poll showing only 36 per cent of Austrians approve of membership - the second-lowest rate in the EU after the UK.The underlying reason for the apparent unpopularity of Brussels is that many Austrians are unconvinced about the benefits of the EU's first big enlargement to encompass neighbours in central and eastern Europe - in spite of the fact that no other member state has benefited as much from that opening as Austria itself.The potential extension of the EU further into eastern and south-eastern Europe,let alone the possibility of Turkish membership,reinforces deep public anxiety and comes in spite of the immense economic benefits Austria itself has enjoyed since joining the EU in 1995.Further over the horizon,Austrians are also expressing concerns about the potential dilution of the country's much-prized neutrality,as the EU gains added diplomatic,and - gradually - military,weight.Many Austrians believe neutrality has run its course. The country is participating increasingly in international peacekeeping,such as the plan to contribute troops to the United Nations mission in Chad and becoming more involved in budding EU security structures.Nevertheless,neutrality remains extremely popular - explaining why an initiative by some conservative regional politicians to reconsider Austria's status was quickly squashed by party leaders after a closer look at the opinion polls,a position supported by the traditionally pro-neutrality Social Democrats.So rather than focusing on the impressive growth of Austrian companies that have invested in the east,or on the sharp increases in exports that have benefited the balance of payments,it is job competition,immigration and crime that have dominated public discussion.Even worries about teaching standards have climbed the agenda,as people have grown concerned about the impact on education of increasing numbers of immigrant children,often speaking only limited German,in schools.Demonstrating the underlying xenophobia,far-right political parties together garnered about 15 per cent of the vote last October.But having initially kept its border totally closed to labour from the new EU member states since they joined in 2004,Austria was recently forced to change course because of an acute labour shortage.Next year,thousands of skilled workers will receive work permits for the first time in a shift welcomed by business leaders,but still opposed by trade unions and the public at large.The mood is even more alarmist when it comes to eliminating passport controls on national borders - a step that will follow once Austria's eastern neighbours join the Schengen agreement on police and borderco-operation. To calm such fears,the government has said it will keep thousands of soldiers posted near the border,a move that has aroused anger in the Czech Republic and Hungary.Bilateral relations with both neighbours remain tense. Austrians,who nearly voted against nuclear energy in a referendum in 1978,remain deeply troubled about the Czech nuclear power plant in Temelin,just over the border.Hungarians,meanwhile,are angry about pollution in the river Raab that flows into their country from southern Austria,as well as the recent attempt by Austrian oil and gas group OMV,in which the government holds more than 30 per cent of the shares,to take over its Hungarian rival Mol. In reaction,the Hungarian parliament this month passed a tailor-made law strengthening Mol's defences against foreign raiders.In spite of the OMV-Mol dispute,which may only be resolved by clarification of EU competition law from Brussels,Austria's business relations with eastern Europe remain strong and continue to grow.Austria is the biggest investor in Romania and Bulgaria,the two most recent entrants into the EU,while Austrian companies retain strong positions in immediate neighbours such as the Czech Republic,Slovakia,Hungary and Croatia.More recently,Austria's banks and industrial companies have started reaching out further east. Reassured by their success among their near neighbours,and,in many cases,buoyed by high share prices that reflect investor support for further geographic expansion,Austrian groups have extended their reach towards Ukraine,Russia,Kazakhstan and even politically-isolated Belarus. Just this month,for example,Telekom Austria clinched a deal to buy the second-largest mobile phone group in Belarus.Such activities remain a driver for the Austrian economy,boosting exports and contributing to growth rates of more than 3 per cent over the past two years - putting Austria well ahead of Germany and the EU average.Meanwhile,unemployment of about 4.3 per cent is among the lowest in Europe,while inflation is subdued and the budget deficit has fallen below 1 per cent of gross domestic product.The mood,however,remains muted,in spite of such impressive figures. Perhaps it will take a virtuoso performance,worthy of Mozart himself,by the Austrian football squad finally to convince people how good things really are.20071029S101.085Document FTFT000020071029e3at0001uEUROPEAN VIEW - PAUL BETTSHungary's Mol wary of a Russian checkmate.By PAUL BETTS500 words11 October 2007 Financial Times FTFTLondon Ed2 Page 24 English(c) 2007 The Financial Times Limited.

The fall of the veteran German media entrepreneur was one of the most dramatic in post-war Germany. When he went bankrupt five years ago,it was the largest ever insolvency in Europe's biggest economy.Many wrote him off at the time as he lost the country's second-largest media empire. His long,bitter ongoing campaign to make Deutsche Bank pay for his bankruptcy through a 1.6bn damages claim has added a sad,quixotic note to his decline and fall.That makes his comeback this week all the more remarkable. The German football league has awarded him the rights to market football from the Bundesliga - the German premier league - over the next six years. This is a billion dollar business. But Mr Kirch himself will not be transmitting the games,just marketing themaround to try to get more money for the league - hence the reason why a bankrupt businessman can get back in the game.His return is full of echoes of the past. The name of the company he is using,Sirius,was the name of the first firm he founded,more than 50 years ago. But Mr Kirch's comeback carries a broader lesson and underlines why Europe must change its attitudes to bankruptcy. Indeed,many economists have long argued that while bankruptcy is seen as a sometimes necessary part of entrepreneurship and risk-taking in the US,it still carries a huge stigma in Europe.Mr Kirch is perhaps not the best advertisement for a new,enlightened European attitude to bankruptcy. He is something of an old-school bruiser whose downfall was triggered by poor management. But his surprising comeback at the grand old age of 81 shows that one should never write off a true entrepreneur,however colourful and controversial. 59268154Document FTCOM00020071011e3aa00030FT.com site : OMV chief patiently chips away Mol stronghold.Haig Simonian 539 words10 October 2007 Financial Times (FT.Com) FTCOMEnglish(c) 2007 The Financial Times Limited.

So far,Templeton and Centaurus,two big institutional investors,have come out publicly in favour of a deal.Mr Ruttenstorfer's comments came as Mol announced that it had signed a co-operation agreement with Qatari Petroleum International.The two companies,which have worked together on offshore exploration in Qatar,said they intended to pursue projects of common interest,including new and/or existing natural gas and crude oil exploration,field development and production . . . petrochemical projects and research and development of environmentally friendly energy solutions .Mr Ruttenstorfer played down the announcement,noting that it referred to limited activities and was not something that should change the shareholder structure .He said that OMV had maintained its holding in Mol at the last reported level of 20.2 per cent,in spite of opportunities substantially to increase its stake.Mol's shares are seen as being in play,with hedge fund involvement,although the chances of OMV succeeding remain severely hindered by the fact that so many of Mol's shares lie either with the company or with friendly institutions.20071010A117.110Document FTFT000020071010e3aa0001sNew Zealand's frigid 'Roaring 40s' location for new oil,gas searchBy RAY LILLEYAssociated Press Writer 967 words10 October 200715:56Associated Press Newswires APRSEnglish(c) 2007. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.WELLINGTON,New Zealand (AP) - The Southern Hemisphere's Roaring 40s -- a band of howling winds and mountainous seas in sub-Antarctic waters -- still strike fear in the hearts of mariners.Next year,U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. and OMV AG,Austria's largest company by sales,will enter this terror-inspiring seascape south of New Zealand to search four exploration blocks for natural gas and oil.It's one of the latest examples of the lengths to which oil companies will go to hunt for new resources to feed an energy-hungry world rapidly consuming easily accessible supplies.Elsewhere,U.S. companies have drilled wells six 6 miles into the earth beneath the Gulf of Mexico,this winter Norway will export gas from the seas north of the Arctic Circle,and off Sakahalin island in Far East Russia natural gas will soon be exported from seas that freeze almost six months of the year.A significant find off New Zealand would hugely benefit the country's economy by bringing in royalties and investment dollars and -- perhaps more importantly -- replenishing the country's natural gas reserves,which could run out in 20 years at current use rates.The potential is enormous. The government has said unproven estimates for the Great South Basin,which stretches 450 kilometers (280 miles) from the South Island's southern coastline toward the Antarctic coast,suggest it contains almost 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent,mostly in natural gas.That's nearly ten times the output from New Zealand's biggest gas and oil field,called Maui,over the last 25 years. A really big discovery like a Maui field would be worth billions (of dollars) to the economy,said John Pfahlert,executive officer of New Zealand's Petroleum Exploration & Production Association.Should Exxon and OMV decide to drill,the projects could bring in as much as 1.2 billion New Zealand dollars ($855 million) in investment from the two companies,according to Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven.But commercial production from any fields could still be more than 20 years away,some experts say.That's a potential problem for New Zealand,which is steadily exhausting its reserves of natural gas,used to produce 30 percent of the country's electricity.Without new discoveries,New Zealand will likely run out of natural gas resources in 20 years. That would probably force New Zealand to import liquefied natural gas from abroad at higher prices and invest in receiving terminals and reconversion plants -- or turn to some other form of energy such as coal or oil to fill the gap.The country's known reserves stand at just 200 million barrels of oil and 2,200 billion cubic feet of gas,some of the lowest in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia,for example,has more than 20 times the oil and more than 40 times the gas.Without offshore gas flows,the government would also stand to lose an income source. Between 1970 and 2005,the government has collected over NZ$2.8 billion ($2.1 billion) in petroleum royalties.Industries that depend on gas byproducts such as methanol and fertilizer also would be affected.Still,exploring for potential oil and gas fields underneath the ocean is expensive and time-consuming,especially in the rough seas south of New Zealand. North Sea waters off Scotland look like a mill pond by comparison,said Pfahlert.First,the companies will spend two to three years taking seismic readings,and then another two to three years test drilling promising target areas. There's a 27-month program of testing that will establish just what the potential for oil and gas discoveries is... (and) that will mean a drilling program would be (at) the earliest late 2009,early 2010,said Sydney-based Exxon Mobil spokeswoman,Samantha Potts.Environmental assessment is currently under way and the seismic testing could begin about the end of the year,she said.There's always the risk that search will turn up very little -- or that the gas might be too difficult or expensive to extract. The Great South Basin is,after all,frontier wildcat drilling area,an oil industry term for a region where no resources have yet been found.Once they've gathered the data,Exxon and OMV will have to weigh whether it's worth drilling. The cost of drilling wells ... will be very major so you have to ensure the size of the prize is worth it,said Dave Darby,senior geologist and business development manager with state-funded agency,GNS Science.One offshore well cost an average of about US$15 million to drill in 2006,according to the Web site of oil researcher Energyfiles Ltd.,and costs go up in harsh environments and deep water.Locally owned Greymouth Petroleum,which also won an exploration permit in the Great South Basin,has committed to an initial work program worth NZ$23 million ($16 million) for seismic work,according to its Web site. The company has five years from July 2007 to complete seismic work and then drill and evaluate one exploration well.Exxon Mobil's and OMV's exploration concessions are farther offshore than Greymouth's holding,and their groups will probably have to spend more on both seismic and drilling.The two have declined to provide spending plans for their seismic and exploration programs. Despite the costs and difficulties,experts say the area holds promise. The opportunity to find more gas has the potential for a very significant economic spinoff for New Zealand,said Chris Stone,a geologist and energy analyst with McDougall Stuart Securities Ltd. The benefits of exploration in New Zealand are quite extraordinary. 7Document APRS000020071010e3aa001olNew Zealand's frigid 'Roaring 40s' location for new oil,gas searchBy RAY LILLEYAssociated Press Writer 984 words10 October 200706:41Associated Press Newswires APRSEnglish(c) 2007.

All rights reservedFerenc Gyurscany,the Hungarian prime minister,yesterday pledged to avoid a conflict with Brussels over a planned law that would protect Mol,the country's biggest energy group,from hostile takeovers. It's obvious this regulation has to meet European Union standards. I hope we will fulfil this requirement and if we don't,we have to change (the draft),said Mr Gyurscany in a Financial Times interview.The prime minister was responding to a warning from the European Commission that Budapest would face legal action if its draft law did not comply with EU rules.The draft law,which is due to be ratified this month,is widely seen in the energy industry as an attempt to block a takeover approach from Austria's OMV,which last week made a Dollars 14bn (Euros 10bn,Pounds 6.9bn) conditional bid for Mol.The draft law,popularly called Lex Mol,will not target foreign bidders as such but will give the authorities rights to protect assets of strategic importance.Mr Gyurscany said he was not against foreign take-overs but he had concerns about state-controlled companies and sovereign investment funds.Although the prime minister did not name OMV in this context,its biggest shareholder is the Austrian state. Mr Gyurscany said: We privatised Mol because we believe Mol has to be in private hands. He defended Hungary's right to define a few sectors,including energy,as strategic. He said: Hungary is one of the most open economies in this region. We operate a very market-oriented policy but we should not be silly or insane. Mr Gyurscany said that while Mol was a private company it was an important Hungarian company in the sense that it represented Hungarian corporate culture and was very sensitive to Hungary's interests .Mr Gyurscany is trying to tread a careful line between EU rules and popular demands for protecting Mol. Almost all Hungarians want Mol to remain Hungarian-owned and are particularly annoyed by a hostile approach from Vienna,the former imperial power.20071006A103.345Document FTFT000020071006e3a60000dFRONT PAGE - COMPANIES &MARKETSBrussels threatens Hungary with court case over Mol takeover law.By ANDREW BOUNDS,ED CROOKS and STEFAN WAGSTYL378 words5 October 2007 Financial Times FTFTEurope Ed1 Page 17 English(c) 2007 The Financial Times Limited.

Janos Koka,Hungary's economy minister,told the Financial Times: It's not about protection against foreign investors. It's about protection against illegal hostile demands. McCreevy's letter,seen by the FT,said he had opened an investigation into the move and would also press home a case before the European Court of Justice concerning Hungary's privatisation law.That case was filed in December because Budapest had failed to make changes to areas that discriminated against foreign investors. Hungary has been seeking to settle the action before a court hearing.In the letter,addressed to Mr Koka,Mr McCreevy wrote: If the actions or legislation currently envisaged by your authorities were to put an impediment on economic factors from other member states taking an interest in Mol,then I would be compelled to recommend that the Commission continues the existing proceedings to their conclusion in the court. The intervention from Brussels is a blow to Mol's hopes of preserving its independence but the OMV approach still faces formidable obstacles.Mol believes that a takeover would force the sale of at least one of Mol's most attractive assets,its refineries in Hungary and Slovakia,to comply with EU competition rules.Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer,OMV's chief executive,said in an interview with a Hungarian magazine yesterday he expected that the merged company would be forced only to dispose of some petrol stations.20071005E117.227Document FTFT000020071005e3a500034COMPANIES - EUROPEEU threatens action on Mol move.By ANDREW BOUNDS,ED CROOKS and STEFAN WAGSTYL440 words5 October 2007 Financial Times FTFTAsia Ed1 Page 19 English(c) 2007 The Financial Times Limited.

All rights reservedThis year alone three of Europe's biggest energy groups have announced they are considering investing billions of dollars in Iran's giant gas fields.But a non-binding memorandum of understanding signed late last month by OMV,the Austrian energy group,and similar recent accords with Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell and Repsol,of Spain,do not necessarily mean those companies are about to sink large sums into Iran and incur the wrath of Washington,which is trying to isolate Tehran over its nuclear ambitions. Instead,these are ways companies are trying to keep their options open until the international diplomatic situation improves or Iran forces them to stop procrastinating.Frank Harris,analyst at Wood Mackenzie,the consulting group,said: Access to gas around the world is getting tougher and the big players cannot afford to ignore Iran. They need to retain the option to participate in Iran because the political winds may change,which is why we are seeing the non-binding deals. No European company has made a large new investment in Iran since Norway's Statoil invested Dollars 2.65bn (Euros 1.9bn,Pounds 1.3bn) in 2002,says Kenneth Katzman,a Middle East expert at the Congressional Research Service. While some have made friendly overtures and promised to consider investing,those in more advanced negotiations have delayed decisions that would have forced them to commit large sums of money.Last month,Gholamhossein Nozari,managing director of Iran's state-owned oil company and the country's deputy energy minister,said he had given Total,the French energy group,four more months to decide whether to invest some Dollars 2bn-Dollars 4bn in the South Pars natural gas project. The deadline had been March 31.Iran was compelled to give Total the extension because the country needs an experienced company to get its liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry off the ground. Total argued it had to consider the fact that the project's costs had doubled because of a worldwide industry shortage of labour and equipment.Even Lukoil,Russia's second biggest oil company,is cautious. Vagit Alekperov,its chief executive,said recently: Today Russia is making resolutions with other UN Security Council members aimed at stopping the Iranian nuclear programme. So we are now looking at the risk. He said the company was in the early stages of investment in Iran and still had 12-18 months before having to decide on any major expenditures.But companies may not be able to drag their feet for ever. Iran has already asserted its muscle in negotiations it views as having lasted too long. Late last year it slashed the stake of Japan's Inpex,which was to develop the giant Azadegan oil field,from 75 per cent to 10 per cent after the group - under pressure from the US - had delayed a final decision several times.Not only Inpex is feeling the heat from the White House. In March,Nicholas Burns,a senior state department official,told a congressional hearing the US had contacted several governments and companies to warn them they would be in violation of the Iran Sanctions Act if they pursued their planned investments in Iran. Such threats appear to have worked for the Europeans,but not for energy-hungry Asian companies which are calling Washington's bluff.Passed in 1996 as the Iran Libya Sanctions Act,the law requires Washington to place sanctions on non-US companies investing more than Dollars 20m a year in Iran. But the White House has the right to decline to act if it deems it in the US's national interest. So far not one company has been sanctioned despite at least 14 violations totalling Dollars 100bn since 1999,the Congressional Research Service reported.How long Total,Shell and others are able to postpone deadlines will depend in part on whether Iran can lure suitors,such as those from China and India. In the past three years,Chinese,Indian and Malaysian companies agreed to invest more than Dollars 90bn to purchase Iranian gas,develop oil and gas fields and build pipelines,LNG terminals and other energy infrastructure,Mr Katzman said in a report.China National Offshore Oil is negotiating a Dollars 16bn dollar deal to develop Iran's North Pars gas field.However,there is a catch: these new Asian investors are relatively untested and it is far from certain they have the ability to develop vast,complex oil and gas projects,especially without being able to rely on US technology or contractors,which are banned.But Mr Harris points out: There is always the possibility the Iranians may attempt to do the first LNG project without IOC help (probably with the Chinese),accepting it may take longer and be less efficient but that it gets them into the game. 20070510L108.106Document FTFT000020070510e35a00017Total: Biofuels JV With Neste Unlikely To Be Resurrected229 words14 March 200714:29Dow Jones International News DJIEnglish(c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,Inc.PARIS (Dow Jones)--The Neste-Total joint biodiesels project has been deferred rather than abandoned,but it is unlikely to be resurrected,a senior executive at Total SA (TOT) said Tuesday.

The nuclear policy reversal triggered billions of euros in extra charges for the utilities,which cut investment and pledged to conserve cash in response.Scrapping its plans to participate in the multibillion-euro Nabucco project could help RWE to save a significant amount of cash.Nabucco was named for a Verdi opera after the founding members of the Nabucco consortium listened to Verdi's Nabucco opera at the Vienna State Opera in 2002.

The important thing is that Caspian gas flows to Europe and that it arrives in the quantities,and where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,we need it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,said Grossmann                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,adding that RWE would be happy to source gas via other pipelines.Whether the pipeline is called Nabucco or Turandot doesn't really matter to us,Grossmann said in reference to the operas by Italian composers Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini.The founding members of the Nabucco project had formed the consortium at a meeting in Vienna and subsequently listened to Verdi's Nabucco opera at the Vienna State Opera in 2002. On the contrary,we are pleased about all solutions [to ship Caspian gas to Europe] that keep our own financial exposure limited                                            ,Grossmann said.RWE and six other European energy companies--including Austria's OMV AG (OMV.VI)--have been planning to build the Nabucco pipeline for years and have had strong political support for the project from the European Union,which considered the project key to diversify gas sources away from its presently dominant supplier                                                                                                                                                                     ,Russia.However                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,the costs for Nabucco are enormous--officially EUR7.9 billion                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,with some industry observers expecting the price tag to rise considerably. A recent agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan to build a pipeline from the Caspian Sea to Turkey's western border,with the aim of exporting gas from Azerbaijan to Europe                                                                                                                                          ,has also raised fresh doubt over the Nabucco project.Grossmann said that RWE's involvement in Nabucco has already paid off for the company. We have exploration licenses in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan that have certainly increased in value                           ,he said                                                                                                                                                                    ,adding that these concessions were gained in talks related to the Nabucco project.Grossmann also said that RWE may not need to sell as many assets as it had expected in August,when the company said it planned to dispose of assets worth up to EUR11 billion as part of its effort to repair its balance sheet.Grossmann said he would now stress the wording up to,more than the figure EUR11 billion                                                                                                        ,declining to detail a new target. For some of our operating businesses,we are now more optimistic and have better results contributions than we had anticipated at the time [of announcing the target]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,he said.For instance                                                                                                                                             ,the company's lignite-fired power plants are generating solid profit margins                                                          ,helped by relatively low fuel costs and weak prices for carbon dioxide emissions allowances. RWE operates opencast lignite mines in western Germany that supply its power plants.So far,RWE has sold assets worth some EUR1.5 billion                                                                                                               ,including its German gas and power transmission networks Thyssengas and Amprion.Grossmann added that RWE could sell minority stakes in its German power distribution networks,possibly to municipalities. In a similar transaction                                                                             ,RWE last year sold 75% of its electricity grid business Amprion to a group of financial investors                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,including insurance companies.At present                                                                                                                                                                  ,RWE is in talks with German municipalities to sell stakes in three regional energysuppliers--Suewag,Kevag and VSE--with Suewag alone expected to generate proceeds of around EUR800 million                         ,according to people familiar with the matter.Grossmann ruled out that RWE could sell interests in other regional energy suppliers                                                ,however.The company's asset-disposal program is part of its broader effort to reduce debt and protect its credit ratings after the German nuclear policy reversal.

It is possible that oil may have been remobilised . . . so the potential for further oiling of areas of coastline exists. Dr Kirk said there had been no new sightings of oil since November 16                                                                                                           ,and the company was monitoring the Kapiti Coast beaches periodically .He estimated that less than 600 litres of oil had been spilt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,but Mr Henderson said Maritime NZ had not yet confirmed the amount.Greater Wellington regional council harbourmaster Mike Pryce said he was satisfied that all the oiled sand had been removed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,and unless further oil sightings were reported                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,he was happy with the action that OMV had taken.The council's team leader of environmental protection services Susan Smith said the council had sent away samples of the oil so its source could be proven - despite OMV taking responsibility for it.Once that had been done,the council would follow up with OMV                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,which could result in the company receiving an infringement notice or being prosecuted.Maritime NZ is also carrying out its own investigation into the cause of the spill.Dr Kirk said OMV had taken a prudent approach even though independent experts had indicated the environmental impact of the oil globules washed up on shore would be low. The company restarted production at the Raroa a week ago.Dr Kirk said the leak occurred because of a faulty joint on a pipe running through the cargo and ballast tanks.

But recipients of the divi are not all fat cats                                                      ,and they are certainly not all British. About 40% of BP's dividends are paid to US small investors and pension fund members                                                                                                                        ,including teachers in California and Texas. These are people like Miriam Sullivan                                                                                                                                                                                           ,the 74-year-old wife of a retired New Jersey teacher                                                                                                                                           ,who told Bloomberg she stands to lose $10                                                                                                                                                        ,000 a year if the BP dividend is suspended.US companies have wreaked more than their fair share of environmental havoc and loss of life. There was Exxon Valdez and Piper Alpha. The escalation of the BP row last week overshadowed another story in an Indian courtroom,where seven local employees of the US multinational Union Carbide were convicted of causing death by negligence at its plant in Bhopal in 1984                             ,when a toxic leak killed thousands of people. Union Carbide's American chairman                                                                                                ,Warren Anderson                                                                                                                                                                       ,has never been brought to justice and is listed as an absconder by the court.The real problem is not Brit-bashing by US politicians. It is,as US commentator Thomas Friedman has pointed out                     ,that Obama has missed an opportunity to move the discussion on to the underlying issues of climate change and the developed world's addiction to oil.The horrific effects of this addiction are not confined to the environment. A report published in Sweden last week by the European Coalition on Oil in Sudan (ECOS) went unremarked in the UK but its allegations are devastating.ECOS claims its research shows that a consortium of oil companies - Lundin of Sweden,Malaysian group Petronas and Austrian concern OMV - should be investigated for complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan. The oil companies  ,ECOS says                                                                                                                             ,worked alongside the perpetrators of rape                                                                                                                                              ,torture                                                                                                                                                     ,child abduction and forced displacement                                                                                                                                      ,and the consortium's infrastructure enabled the commission of crimes.

Unlike the BP crisis                                                                                         ,much of this happens below the media radar in this country and the US                              ,as does an enormous amount of damage to the environment. To take one example                                    ,the people of the Niger delta                                                                                                                                                    ,which supplies 40% of US crude imports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,have had their lives blighted by oil pollution for decades.BP and its bosses richly deserve to be pilloried over Deepwater but this is far too important to be reduced to a puerile slanging match. When the US president speaks to David Cameron this week and meets the BP chairman,Carl-Henric Svanberg                              ,there needs to be a constructive dialogue. There is still time to grasp this opportunity for real change.To sustain our oil addiction                                      ,companies are pushing the boundaries into controversial areas such as tar sands,into conflict zones                                                                                                                     ,and into joint ventures with oligarchs. We have entered the era of Extreme Oil. Deepwater does not tell us much about the sins of British oil companies versus American ones. It tells us a great deal about the huge costs,human                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,financial and environmental                                                                                                                      ,of being hooked on oil. The US is the world's biggest consumer. Reducing that consumption and moving towards a more sustainable economy would have enormous benefits: it would cut emissions of greenhouse gases,leave the US less vulnerable to oil price spikes and lessen the need to deal with oil-rich countries that may compromise foreign policy.Obama could have used his political capital to initiate a serious discussion on how to end our dangerous dependency. How saddening that                         ,so far                                                                                                                                                                                          ,he has chosen not to.Document OB00000020100614e66d0001mActivists Protest against Crude Oil Pipeline Project in Bratislava393 words28 April 201013:17SITA Slovenska Tlacova Agentura SITAEnglish(c) 2010 SITA - Slovenska Tlacova AgenturaBRATISLAVA,April 28                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,(SITA) -- Environmental activists from Greenpeace Slovakia symbolically spilled crude oil on a model of Zitny Ostrov                                                                                                                                  ,the largest source of drinking water in central Europe                                                                                                                ,in front of the seat of the firm Transpetrol on Wednesday. The environmental activists thus protested against the controversial plan to build a crude oil pipeline across the protected territory around the Slovak capital. The Slovak public should know that behind the planned construction of the pipeline is,in addition to interests of the Austrian firm OMV                 ,also the interest of the Slovak firm Transpetrol                                                                                            ,in the hands of the state through the Economy Ministry. “We do not want our largest drinking water source in central Europe to yet another potential source of pollution. A crude oil pipeline simply does not fit in Zitny Ostrov. Drinking water is the strategic resource of the 21st century.Protection of such strategic resources must be an absolute priority for Slovakia,” said coordinator of Greenpeace’s toxic campaign Katerina Ventusova.According to available information,Transpetrol proposed the disputed route of the pipeline on the Slovak side                                                                                                                                                                ,explained Greenpeace activists. The company is also the majority stockholder in the Slovak-Austrian company                               ,which is to build and operate the pipeline in Austria. Greenpeace claims it has information at its disposal according to which the Austrian side counts on construction of the pipeline across Zitny Ostrov and connection to the Austrian pipeline near the village of Kittsee. Ms. Ventusova added that the controversial alternative of the pipeline’s construction should be rejected as soon as possible.The crude oil pipeline connecting the Bratislava-based oil refiner Slovnaft and the OMV refinery in the Austrian Schwechat should have originally started in 2012. Austria is interested in building the pipeline mainly to enable direct import of Russian crude oil. According to the original project,the crude oil pipeline between Slovakia and Austria should have had 62 kilometers with 12 kilometers in Slovakia. Its capacity should be about 2.5-5 million tons of crude oil per year. The construction of the crude oil pipeline should be carried out by the Slovak company Transpetrol and the Austrian firm OMV,which established the companyBratislava-Schwechat Pipeline. Slovakia’s Environment Ministry issued a negative position on the project within the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).qk dpDocument SITA000020100429e64s0000lSTOCKS NEWS EMERGING EUROPE-Petrom gains after wind power buy248 words15 April 201011:33Reuters News LBAEnglish(c) 2010 Reuters LimitedSTOCKS NEWS	Reuters	Regional Stocks Stocks on the move [HOT-RTRS]	Real-time Equity News [E]	[.CEE]REGIONAL INDICESWarsaw WIG20 <.WIG20>	Bucharest Beti <.BETI> Budapest SE Index <.BUX>	Prague PX <.PX>Zagreb Crobex <.CRBEX>	Sofia Sofix <.SOFIX>Ljubljana SBI20 <.SBI>	Istanbul ISE National 100 <.XU100> Moscow RTS <.IRTS>0931 GMT 15Apr2010 - Petrom gains after wind power buy--------------------------------------------------------------Shares in oil and gas group Petrom gain nearly 2 percent after Romania's biggest listed company says it is buying a planned wind power project as it seeks to diversify into electricity production.

In July,U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said he wanted to axe funding for research and development on cars that run on hydrogen fuel cells                                                                                                                               ,partly because they would require the creation of a network of fueling stations.The U.S. government has spent roughly $1.5 billion since 2001 on hydrogen fuel-cell research. Chu argued that improved internal-combustion engines and plug-in electric vehicles were more realistic technologies for cutting oil consumption over the next 20 to 30 years.However,Zetsche said General Motors Co.                                                                                                                                                                                  ,Adam Opel GmbH                                                                                                                                        ,Honda Motor Co.

Production is expected to be around 200 cars in 2009 and pave the way forlarge-scale production from 2015 on.Daimler executive board member Thomas Weber told Dow Jones in a recent interview that Daimler has so far invested around EUR1 billion in research and development costs for fuel-cell technology and pledged to keep up investing in this field.He said by 2015 hydrogen-powered cars would have to be cost-efficient enough to attract a broader range of customers. Customers will only buy these cars if they're just about a few thousand euros more expensive than cars with a conventional engine,but not more                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,Weber said.Company Web site: -By Christoph Rauwald                                                 ,Dow Jones Newswires +49 69 29 725 512 (Stephen Power of The Wall Street Journal in Washington contributed to this article.)
